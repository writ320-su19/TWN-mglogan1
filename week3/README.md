Through the collection of  information from different tests, the data will determine whether the learner is ready to move to the next stage of PECS, or Picture Exchange Communication System. If the learner is showing progress with the system, they should continue to use PECS. If the learner with Autism Spectrum Disorder, you should then ask yourself the following questions to determine whether or not you should select a different route:
+ Do the pictures/symbols need to be changed to more preferable items?
+ Do additional pictures/symbols need to be added for easier use?
+ Are the pictures/symbols presented exciting the learner, making them more motivated to use the device?
+ Is the correct level of assistance such as prompting or physical assistance being used?
+ Does the learner need to go back to previous settings for more assistance?
+ PECS one
+ Has the therapist completed the PECS training website, see Pyramid Educational Consultantsâ„¢ website for training opportunities at http://www.pecsusa.com.
If all of these issues have been addressed and the learner with Austism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) does not show progress, consider selecting a different evidence-based practices to use with a learner with ASD.
