+ **Project Description**
+ For our semester long Technical Report project, I have decided to do a documentation project on different medical device companies. I am wanting to dip my toes in the water in this field after I finish my summer classes. I feel like by doing this project it will be helping with my job hunting as well as further my knowledge in technical writing. I plan on making infographics for each company or device. These infographics will include information on different things such as average yearly income for salesmen and women, reviews on devices, reviews on employees' experiences at the company, and other factors that would play into determining which company would be best to work for, for my audience. My project will be focused on an audience that is interested in entering the medical device sales field, looking for entry-level positions in different companies around the United States. My project is focused on a very broad audience with no age-range or specific group.
